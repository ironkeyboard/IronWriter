### version 1.0
A text rewriting suite in terminal

### wtf why?
I thought it would be interesting to try my hand at the topic of text rewriting! 
Plus - Why use grammarly when you can copy paste into terminal and have it autodetect synonyms for you ;)

### Use...
its pretty hard ngl:
- start the program
- enter a sensitivity
- wait a couple seconds for it to process synonyms
- select synoyms 
- you're done...

### Still sucks?
cool new things coming in the future such as
- slighty decent code?!
- translation api paraphrasing
- congugation of replacements (yeah i dont do english)

### Wait theres a website?
*oh yes*
